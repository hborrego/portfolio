              The Archipelago of San Andres, Providencia and Santa Catalina is
              situated in the Caribbean Sea, at the maritime border between
              Nicaragua and Colombia. The archipelago is home of the Raizals — a
              Creole-speaking people of Afro-Caribbean and British descent — who
              have occupied the archipelago for centuries.
            </p>
            <p class="text-passport passport1">
              Historically, the archipelago has been a highly contested
              territory between nations — most notably between Colombia and
              Nicaragua — for its territorial waters, which have caused
              generations of negligence and displacement for the Raizals.
            </p>
            <p class="text-passport passport2">
              Since the Raizals are citizens of Colombia, the fight between
              Managua and Bogotá in the last decade over their territory has
              created a series of inconvenient divisions in the place that they
              have always known, related to, and understood.
            </p>
            <p class="text-passport passport3">
              The Raizals have lost their freedom to fish and visit the places
              that they have gone to for centuries. Although these territorial
              divisions are merely a series of dotted lines illustrated on maps,
              they are enforced and affect their freedom.
            </p>
            <p class="text-passport passport4">
              These debates between nations have ignored the fact that the
              archipelago is a network of islands, banks, cays, and other atolls
              that act as one connected system and as such, the Raizals should
              have the freedom to move around it without restrictions.

          As usual, Eric leaves his house at 3:00am to go finishing, because
          around that time there is a mild wind around the archipelago of San
          Andres, Providencia and Santa Catalina. He normally doesn’t have to go
          that far from the shore to find a good shoal, but today he and other
          fisherman know that they have to follow the fish further north, close
          to the Quita Sueño and Serrana banks, where they like to go sometimes.
          On the afternoon of the November 19, 2012, after a long day on the
          water, Eric overheard other fishermen complaining about the news of
          some International Court, who decided to rule in favor of Nicaragua
          against Colombia. Eric was familiar with the dispute, in which
          Nicaragua claimed sovereignty over some islands and the maritime
          border with Colombia, right across the archipelago.
        </p>
        <div></div>
        <p>
          As Eric takes a glimpse to the map in the newspaper, which illustrated
          the new limits, he noticed that Quita Sueño and Serrana are now
          surrounded by Nicaraguan waters, making them the only two Colombian
          enclaves. Eric didn’t fully understand what that meant or how exactly
          that was going to affect their lives. For him, the archipelago is a
          network of islands, banks, cays, and other atolls that act as one
          connected system. He has gone to these places since he was a kid and
          learned from his father how to read the ocean and follow the fish, who
          don’t understand about borders or politics. A few months after he
          heard that Patricio, his close friend, has lost his boat to the
          Nicaraguan army because he crossed the border while finishing.
          Patricio told Eric how he wanted to get close to the spot they used to
          go up north. The Nicaraguan coast guards have confiscated his boat
          because he crossed a line that he could not see or understand.
