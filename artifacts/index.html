          As usual, Eric leaves his house at 3:00am to go finishing, because
          around that time there is a mild wind around the archipelago of San
          Andres, Providencia and Santa Catalina. He normally doesn’t have to go
          that far from the shore to find a good shoal, but today he and other
          fisherman know that they have to follow the fish further north, close
          to the Quita Sueño and Serrana banks, where they like to go sometimes.
          On the afternoon of the November 19, 2012, after a long day on the
          water, Eric overheard other fishermen complaining about the news of
          some International Court, who decided to rule in favor of Nicaragua
          against Colombia. Eric was familiar with the dispute, in which
          Nicaragua claimed sovereignty over some islands and the maritime
          border with Colombia, right across the archipelago.
        </p>

          As Eric takes a glimpse to the map in the newspaper, which illustrated
          the new limits, he noticed that Quita Sueño and Serrana are now
          surrounded by Nicaraguan waters, making them the only two Colombian
          enclaves. Eric didn’t fully understand what that meant or how exactly
          that was going to affect their lives. For him, the archipelago is a
          network of islands, banks, cays, and other atolls that act as one
          connected system. He has gone to these places since he was a kid and
          learned from his father how to read the ocean and follow the fish, who
          don’t understand about borders or politics. A few months after he
          heard that Patricio, his close friend, has lost his boat to the
          Nicaraguan army because he crossed the border while finishing.
          Patricio told Eric how he wanted to get close to the spot they used to
          go up north. The Nicaraguan coast guards have confiscated his boat
          because he crossed a line that he could not see or understand.
