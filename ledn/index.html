              Bitcoin collateral.

          <div class="width-42">
            <p>
              One of the main issues with the existing loan repayment process
              was that it was handled mostly manually by staff members at Ledn.
              For instance, if a user wanted to liquidate the Bitcoin that they
              used as collateral to get a loan in dollars, they would have to
              get a quote through Email, which they would have limited time to
              accept due to bitcoin volatility exchange rates. For users, the
              repayment process was a
              <strong>challenging experience</strong> as some of the quotes
              needed to be fulfilled within a certain timeframes using
              irritating ways of communication.

              <br />
              <br />

              Staff were also responsible of checking bank transactions, selling
              assets, and cross checking information manually. The lack of
              automation was
              <strong>inefficient and prompt to human error</strong>, plus it
              created <strong> major overhead for the company</strong>.

                I worked among a UX Researcher and a Product Owner during the

                <strong>framed the challenges</strong>, which made the current
                repayment structure suffer the most,
                <strong>conducted research</strong>, which refined our focus on
                what needed our attention the most, and

            The existing repayment solution relied on users to access the
            platform to submit a repayment request and then confirming to a
            quote via email. There was little explanation how to use all the
            available payment options, too, which created a frustrating
            experience when a user was looking for a particular form of payment.

          <p class="margin-0">
            Users struggled to understand the status of their loan, which was
            given to them through the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. For instance,
            when the LTV is high, it means that the loan could get liquidated
            unless the user deposits more collateral. The existing LTV didn't
            give any relevant information, which made it hard for users to make
            informed decisions based on the number they were looking at.

            After users received a loan repayment quote through email, they
            struggled to understand the format of the quote. There was no
            hierarchy and most users often had to use a calculator to understand
            which number was doing what. This often made it harder for some
            users to even respond and confirm repayment.
